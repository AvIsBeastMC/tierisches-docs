# Introduction, Basic Planning & Project Structure
Create a platform where we can register stray/wild animals with RFID/QR code and maintain online database. Assume that the animals are wearing the tags and create dummy QR codes representing RFID and show statistics of the database based on animals, geography and area. Additinoal features can be added to display density geographically, animals facing extintion, area specific animals/breeds etc.

### CRITERIONS
**- Creativity (20%):**

### REQUIREMENTS
- Browser application link (Offline/Online)  
- Source code files  
- Presentation: .PDF Format  
- Analysis of the theme  
- Concept sketches and flowcharts  
- Proposed problem solution  
- Justification of how your solution meets the problem/requirement  
- Implementation (how will you make your solution reach the users)

### GUIDELINES
- Your entry should be submitted before the submission deadline  
- You are required to submit a presentation of your solution to problem statement with a detailed logical steps and flowchart , in PDF format only  
- The entry submitted must be an original idea for Design Championship, provide references to prove the same  
- Although it is not mandatory, but it is advisable to <ins>showcase a video of your workflow</ins> (thought process). Submit such videos of <ins>less than 90 sec duration or maximum 50mb in size</ins>.
- If any copyrighted content is used, specifying credits are compulsory  
- Your entry should not violate any terms and conditions of copyright issues

### BASIC PLANNING
- Since this is a web development project and the tech stack that will be used in the making of this website matters, we will be using **ReactJS** with **Firebase** for the Front-End and Back-end respectively, all of us members are welcomed to suggest and recommend design ideas for the topic and it will be implemented if satisfies its position.
- As you may have read above, PDF with a Video has to be made and placed within the application and will go through as an application as a whole.
- Extra features will prove to be crucial for being a step ahead of other projects with the implementation of **ANIMAL FEATURES**, **DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANIMALS with Unique QR Codes for Identities**, etc, will need more suggestions.
- PDF and Video is also, very crucial for the presentation of our project, since it holds the basis & basics of our project.
- Nobody shall do the work as if it's torture and I'll be responsible for the best and most efficient distribution of processes and works that shall be done throughout the project.
- The project development **may/will be launched by the end of SCIENCE PREBOARD EXAMINATION**, which shall commence on the 12th of this month.
- Staybacks and At-School Project Development *may* not be an option, at least for me, since my parents were affected and disturbed quite a lot due to my times at school which shouldn't have been the problem, but my presence at school was considered unnecessary. May come for some days at most.

### PRESENTATION PARTS
- The Presentation will be divided into two seperate parts
	- Project Structure and Showcasing of Features
	- Technology and Engineering behind-the-scenes Part

### REGISTRATION/ENTRIES OF ANIMALS WITH THE HELP OF USERS
- The user will be required to login/signup through the authentication flow of the web application, which shall require a user to fill certain fields of information to prove their identity before any entries that they will be able to do.
- User shall get their own QR code which shall help redirect users to their profile URL which shall show/display contributions done by the user to pages.
-
