Submit such videos of less than 90 sec duration or maximum 50mb in size .

As you may have read above, PDF with a Video has to be made and placed within the application and will go through as an application as a whole. Extra features will prove to be crucial for being a step ahead of other projects with the implementation of ANIMAL FEATURES , DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ANIMALS with Unique QR Codes for Identities , etc, will need more suggestions. PDF and Video is also, very crucial for the presentation of our project, since it holds the basis & basics of our project. Nobody shall do the work as if it's torture and I'll be responsible for the best and most efficient distribution of processes and works that shall be done throughout the project. The project development may/will be launched by the end of SCIENCE PREBOARD EXAMINATION , which shall commence on the 12th of this month. Staybacks and At-School Project Development may not be an option, at least for me, since my parents were affected and disturbed quite a lot due to my times at school which shouldn't have been the problem, but my presence at school was considered unnecessary. May come for some days at most. Presentation Parts \u00b6 The Presentation will be divided into two seperate parts Project Structure and Showcasing of Features Technology and Engineering behind-the-scenes Part","title":"Introduction & Basic Planning"},{"location":"#introduction-basic-planning","text":"Create a platform where we can register stray/wild animals with RFID/QR code and maintain online database.
